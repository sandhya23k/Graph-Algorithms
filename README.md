Graph-Algorithms

Project Overview

In this project, the goal is to implement various graph algorithms and build a graph network. Additionally, a profession and title dictionary will be constructed. The implemented algorithms include Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra’s algorithm, and strongly connected components.

Project Components

1. Graph Network Implementation: 
    - Implement a graph network structure capable of representing various types of graphs.
    
2. Profession and Title Dictionary:
    - Build a dictionary that maps professions to titles and vice versa.

3. Graph Algorithms Implementation:
    - Implement the following graph algorithms:
        - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
        - Depth-First Search (DFS)
        - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
