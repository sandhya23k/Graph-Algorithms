# Graph-Algorithms

Project Description
In this project you need to implement graph algorithms. You will be building a graph network.
In addition, you will need to build a profession and title dictionary. After that you will need to
code and implement test cases for graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s and strongly
connected components. More details about these will be given below. 

Project Package
For this project, you will be given a few files that you need to work with. Those files include the
one dataset files, two skeleton code files, and one python code file to run the test cases. The
testing python script tells you how many test cases your code passed and failed.

Dataset
For this project you will be using the imdb_network.csv. The required data is
extracted and provided as CSV file.
(1) Imdb_network.csv file

The dataset file includes the following attributes as columns.
tconst – a unique identifier for each movie
nconst – a unique identifier for each person
primaryTitle – popular title that is used for promotions
primaryName – name by which a person is often credited
primaryProfession – top 3 professions of a person
